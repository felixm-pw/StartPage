# Browser Start Page
I wrote this start page based off of a picture I found on Reddit back in 2019. Unfortunatly I never found the original post and no longer have the screenshot so you'll have to trust that this is a faithful recreation!

## Image Modifications
For copyright reasons I have not included the picture however if you want the same one you can [find it here](https://aestheticamagazine.com/meaning-and-melancholy/ "can find it here"). If you want to add your own just make sure the image is exactly 600x240 in size.
